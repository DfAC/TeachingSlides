\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Introduction}

\textbf{Reproducible research} is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them\footnote[frame]{Quoted after Roger Peng (
Johns Hopkins University)}.

\bigskip
This means that both data and the analysis code are available allowing others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.

\bigskip
The aim for this presentation is to discuss the tools available and discuss the reasoning behind it.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{But why?}

In cancer research:

Prof Keith A. Baggerly discussed errors in genomic signatures during Cancer Bioinformatics Workshop, Cambridge 2010\footnote{\url{http://bit.ly/235DoBa}}, there is Coursera course on the topic\footnote{\url{https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research}}.

But its use is widespread in engineering as well:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Stanford Exploration Project - \url{http://sepwww.stanford.edu/}
	\item Computer vision - \url{http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~xinl/}
	\item Wavelab - \url{http://finmath.stanford.edu/~wavelab/}

\end{itemize}
