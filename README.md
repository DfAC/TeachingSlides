This repo contains the source code for the following presentation:

* Teaching material for MSc courses at the University of Nottingham for following modules, that is:
  * H24VSP Satellite Based Positioning Practical
  * H24VLP Navigation Technology Practical
  * H24VEP Deformation Monitoring Practical
* Other, related, talks that I gave:
  * Reproducible Research, discussing use of R/python in order to maintain code and data for research



## Teaching slides status

I am trying to update my slides regulary before the event, and then, periodically after the envent. In case of the teaching there will be a major update every year, which might be important if you intended to use slides. A tick indicates that slides have been updated for this year lectures and no major changes are expected.

- [ ] **H24VSP_PPP** - H24VSP Project 3 (NRTK vs PPP) introduction slides
- [ ] **H24VEP_Bridge** -  H24VLP Project 3 Bridge monitoring introduction slides
- [x] **H24VLP_P1_MP** - H24VLP Project 1 (Multipath) introduction slides
- [x] **H24VLP_P2_IMU** -  H24VLP Project 2 Sensor integration handout
  - to convert POSRS data copy all user.* files to `c:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\NovAtel\Waypoint_8_50\User\`


## Supporting repos

A number of related repos exist, further supporting teaching. Those are listed below. Similary as with list above tick indicates that no major reviews are expected this year.

* [x] [TEQCSPEC repo](https://github.com/DfAC/TEQCSPEC) contains Matlab code used at 24VSP Satellite Based Positioning Practical Project 1 (Multipath).


## PhD Support

There is a number of private repos, supporting our current research. Please get in touch with me (ezzlkb) if you need more information.
