This repo contains the source code for the MSc courses teaching material at the University of Nottingham (NGI). Following  modules are included:
  * H24VSP Satellite Based Positioning Practical
  * H24VLP Navigation Technology Practical
  * H24VEP Deformation Monitoring Practical
  
I also contains presentations that I gave:
  * Reproducible Research, discussing use of R/python in order to maintain code and data for research



## Teaching slides status

I am trying to update my slides regulary before the event and, then, periodically after the event. As far as the teaching material is concerned, there will be a major update every year, which might be important if you intended to use these slides. A tick indicates that slides have been updated for this year lectures and no major changes are expected.

- [x] **H24VSP_PPP** - H24VSP Project 3 (NRTK vs PPP) introduction slides
- [x] **H24VEP_Bridge** -  H24VLP Project 3 Bridge monitoring introduction slides
- [x] **H24VLP_P1_MP** - H24VLP Project 1 (Multipath) introduction slides
- [x] **H24VLP_P2_IMU** -  H24VLP Project 2 Sensor integration handout
  - to convert POSRS data copy all user.* files to `c:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\NovAtel\Waypoint_8_50\User\`


## Supporting repos

A number of related repos exist, and are listed below. In the same way as with the list above, tick indicates that no major reviews are expected.

* [x] [TEQCSPEC repo](https://github.com/DfAC/TEQCSPEC) contains Matlab code used at 24VSP Satellite Based Positioning Practical Project 1 (Multipath).


## PhD Support

There is a number of private repos, supporting our current research. Please get in touch with me (ezzlkb) if you need more information.
